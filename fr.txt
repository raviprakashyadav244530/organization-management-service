Intern
 
Assignment
 
-
 
Organization
 
Management
 
Service
 
Objective
 
Build
 
a
 
backend
 
service
 
using
 
any
 
backend
 
framework
 
of
 
your
 
choice
 
preferably
 
a
 
Python
 
framework
 
(Django/FastAPI)
 
that
 
supports
 
creating
 
and
 
managing
 
organizations
 
in
 
a
 
multi-tenant
 
style
 
architecture.
 
It
 
is
 
preferred
 
to
 
use
 
MongoDB
 
as
 
a
 
database.
 
The
 
system
 
should
 
maintain
 
a
 
Master
 
Database
 
for
 
global
 
metadata
 
and
 
create
 
dynamic
 
collections
 
for
 
each
 
organization.
 
Your
 
task
 
is
 
to
 
design
 
and
 
implement
 
the
 
required
 
REST
 
APIs
 
and
 
authentication
 
flow.

Technical
 
Requirements
 
A.
 
Master
 
Database
 
Should
 
store:
 
●
 
Organization
 
metadata
 
●
 
Connection
 
details
 
for

dynamic

●
 
Admin
 
user
 
credentials
 
(securely
 
hashed)
 
B.
 
Dynamic
 
Collection
 
Creation
 
When
 
an
 
organization
 
is
 
created:
 
●
 
Programmatically
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
Mongo
 
collection
 
for
 
that
 
organization.
 
●
 
The
 
collection
 
can
 
be
 
empty
 
or
 
initialized
 
with
 
a
 
basic
 
schema
 
(optional
 
but
 
good
 
to
 
have).
 
C.
 
Authentication
 
●
 
Implement
 
admin
 
login
 
using
 
JWT.
 
●
 
Passwords
 
must
 
be
 
hashed
 
(e.g.,
 
bcrypt).
 
 
 
Additional
 
questions
 
 
Do
 
you
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
architecture
 
with
 
a
 
scalable
 
design?
 
What
 
can
 
be
 
the
 
trade-offs
 
with
 
the
 
tech
 
stack
 
and
 
design
 
choices?
 
Please
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
explain
 
briefly
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
design
 
something
 
better.
 
We
 
would
 
love
 
to
 
hear
 
that.
